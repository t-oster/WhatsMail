# WhatsMail
WhatsMail will be an (Android) E-Mail client (IMAP,POP), which mimics the look and behavior of WhatsApp.
This repository is the starting point for every one, who wants to contribute, because I won't hate time to program this in the near future, but in my mind it's already done and it will be awesome:

## Features
 * Shows all contacts from your phonebook which have E-Mail Adresses with Avatar
 * Displays all E-Mails in your inbox as Conversations like WhatsApp
 * Easy sending of Attachments, Pictures and Locations
 * GroupChat: No idea yet how to do those. Mailinglists will automatically work, but creating a group of several conacts is easy, but no idea on how to find out if the response is to the group or an individual e-mail
 * Push notifications with the IMAP connection staying alive
